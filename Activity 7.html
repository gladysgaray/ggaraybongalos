<h1>All About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there I am Gladys P. Garay , I am currently pursuing my Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Bohol. Aside from being a student, I am also a wife and an entrepreneur.<br></br>
One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I come of as a very shy individualistic person but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I give.<br></br>
My favorite hobby is watching movies. I love watching different kinds of movies whenever I am free. I can spend my leisure time watching it. And I also love going to the beach, the place where I feel most comfortable, a place where I am calm and a place that is peaceful in its own ways. And it is the place to go to get away from all my troubles.<br></br> 
</p>
