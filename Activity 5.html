  <h1>HOW TO GET OVER WHEN YOU ARE AT YOUR MOST LOWEST</h1>
  <p>Undergoing tough times usually involves some kind of loss. Whether it is the loss of a loved one, the loss of a job, or the loss of your old life, it is important you allow yourself the opportunity to grieve. Only by facing your grief, acknowledging and mourning your losses will you be able to heal and eventually move on with your life.</p>
  <p>It is tempting to believe that the best way to get through hard times is by ignoring painful emotions and putting on a brave face. But unpleasant emotions exist whether you choose to acknowledge them or not.</p>
  <p>Trying to prevent your emotions from surfacing will only fuel your stress, delay acceptance of your new situation, and prevent you from moving on. By allowing yourself to feel your emotions, you will find that even the most intense, upsetting feelings will pass, the trauma of these tough times will start to fade, and you will be able to find a path forward.</p>
